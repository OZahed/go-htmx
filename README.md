# a TEMPLATE for HTMX with golang

This repository is dedicated to creating a Copy/Paste style boilerplate for HTMX projects, this is the way I use it
The next step would be adding a command line tool to create the project template boilerplate

## template

the template uses a simple counter application using HTMX and golang templates
