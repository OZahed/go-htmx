# [TEMPLATE]: HTMX-todo

This repository is dedicated to create a Copy/Paste style boiler plate for HTMX projects, this is the way I personally use it
next step would be adding a command line tool to create the project template boiler plate

## template

the template uses an simple todoList application using sqlite3 as the database
