# [WIP]: HTMX-boilerplate

This repository is dedicated to create a Copy/Paste style boiler plate for HTMX projects, this is the way I personally use it
next step would be adding a command line tool to create the project template boiler plate

WIP:

- [ ] Add Support for `.templ` files
- [ ] Add command line way to auto generate all the files without git clone
