# a TEMPLATE for HTMX with golang

This repository is dedicated to creating a Copy/Paste style boilerplate for HTMX projects, this is the way I use it.

## Work in progress
- [ ] Adding a command line tool to create the project template boilerplate, something like `npx crate ...`
- [ ] Adding [ah-temp](https://github.com/a-h/templ) as templating language.
